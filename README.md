![feature-image](https://i.imgur.com/6QHjYJF.jpg)


Welcome!

This is a simple Twitter clone application. As I was practicing and to improve my skills in ruby and rails, i tried to build the frontend UI of Twitter real application and this is it. This app will most notably demonstrate a user role system giving your web application and native application feel all within the browser.
